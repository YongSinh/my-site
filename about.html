            <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
            <p>
                Each person has different hobbies, and doing different things gives them joy. Baking is something that gives me comfort and helps me relax. I tried baking after entering college. 
                At first, it was a little stressful, but then I started learning more and more. After a hectic day at college, it helps to relax you. Another thing that helps me relax is reading books.
                I started reading books when I was in school, and over the years, the habit is something that has helped me learn a lot.</p>
                <h3>Dreams and aspirations:</h3>
            <p> While many people have dreams of becoming doctors and lawyers, I have always wanted to be a traveler. I donâ€™t remember when I fell in love with traveling, 
                but over the years, my passion for traveling has increased. Over the past few months, I have started living this dream, and it gives me so much joy.</p>
